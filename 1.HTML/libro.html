    <h1>I. What It's All About</h1>
    <P>Whence come the thousands of photographs used every month by newspapers and magazines?</P>
    <p>More than that, whence do the photographs come which are used by makers of calendars, postcards, for advertisements, and for illustrating books, stories and articles?
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>This little book is a practical, up-to-the-minute answer to the question: "How can I make my camera-work profitable?"

    <p>----------------------</p>
    <p>At first thought, the answer is, <em>"From professional photographers and publisher-photo-services."</em> But professional photographers do not produce one-third of the photographs used, and publisher-photo-services are supplied by that same large number of camerists that supply publications with most of their prints.
    </p>
    <p>No one can deny that the greatest number of prints published are bought from amateur photographers in towns no larger than the average, and sometimes smaller.

    <h3>The markets may be classified briefly:
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Newspapers</li>
        <li>Magazines</li>
        <li>Postcard-makers</li>
        <li>Calendar-makers</li>
        <p>And there are more, of more specialised branches.
        </p>
    </ol>
